## 📊 Understanding the Analysis

### What the App Does:

1. **Receives your photo**
2. **Simulates analysis** (randomized for demo)
3. **Assigns body shape** (one of 5 types)
4. **Assigns face shape** (one of 5 types)
5. **Assigns skin tone** (one of 3 types)
6. **Matches with fashion database**
7. **Shows recommendations**

### Why Simulated?
